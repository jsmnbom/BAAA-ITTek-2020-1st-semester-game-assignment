## Introduction

This is a project for a game assignment in programming (IT Technology 1st semester 2020 at Business Academy Aarhus).

The basic premise of the game is simply to avoid the edges of the screen.

But that alone would of course be too simple. Therefore there's a couple of mechanics to make it as hard as possible to stay on screen. The first and most obvious is that enemies will try to push you - with quite some force even. But even more evil is the fact that your controls will randomly be randomized. You're used to W meaning up, well now it's suddenly H, down is suddently Z and to go left and right you need to press W and 9. Sounds fun doesn't it? ψ\`ー´)ﾉ

## Installation

To play the game you need at least python 3.7 and pip. Then using pip, install the requirements outlined in the requirements.txt file

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then you can start the game by executing the src/main.py file

## How to play

To start the game after launching it, simply hit the SPACEBAR.

Controls to move the player are shown next to the player. They start out being WASD but every once in a while one of the keys are changed to a random letter or number (a-z and 0-9).
