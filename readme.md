# Welcome to hell

## Introduction

This is a project for a game assignment in programming class IT Technology 1semester 2020 Business Academy Aarhus.

The game is written in python and uses pyglet for graphics.
The basic premise of the game is to simply avoid the edges of the screen.
But that alone would of course be too simple. So enemies will try to push you to fail.
But that's not hellish enough, is it? Nope. Our controls will also change often.

## Installation

To play the game you need at least python 3.7 and pip. Then using pip, install the requirements outlined in the requirements.txt file.1semester

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then you can start the game by executing the src/main.py file

## How to play

Controls are shown next to the player. They start out being WASD but every 5 seconds one of the keys are changed to a random letter or number.
