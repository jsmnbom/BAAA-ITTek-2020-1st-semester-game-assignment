<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a project for a game assignment in programming (IT Technology 1st semester 2020 at Business Academy Aarhus).</p>
<p>The basic premise of the game is simply to avoid the edges of the screen.</p>
<p>But that alone would of course be too simple. Therefore there's a couple of mechanics to make it as hard as possible to stay on screen. The first and most obvious is that enemies will try to push you - with quite some force even. But even more evil is the fact that your controls will randomly be randomized. You're used to W meaning up, well now it's suddenly H, down is suddently Z and to go left and right you need to press W and 9. Sounds fun doesn't it? ψ`ー´)ﾉ</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>To play the game you need at least python 3.7 and pip. Then using pip, install the requirements outlined in the requirements.txt file</p>
<p><code>$ pip install -r requirements.txt</code></p>
<p>Then you can start the game by executing the src/main.py file</p>
<h2 id="how-to-play">How to play</h2>
<p>To start the game after launching it, simply hit the SPACEBAR.</p>
<p>Controls to move the player are shown next to the player. They start out being WASD but every once in a while one of the keys are changed to a random letter or number (a-z and 0-9).</p>
<p>As with most games the goal is to get the highest score. To this end when you die, you are able to enter a name for the highscore display on the main menu. To increase your score, run over/eat the spinning white pellets that appear one at a time in the game.</p>
<h2 id="screenshot">Screenshot</h2>
<p>Here's a screenshot from playing the game.</p>
